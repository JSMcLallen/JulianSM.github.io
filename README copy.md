#Phase 1

###Find reference websites

 - Started with Rachel's website along with my manager's [website](https://www.alexanderxhoja.com)
 - Found other websites such as [this one](https://dumbtype.com)
 - Heavily inspired by the minimalist, functional aesthetic in the *Dumb Type* website, finding it refreshingly simple and user-friendly
 
#Phase 2

###A basic layout

 - With a better idea of the contents required on a portfolio website, I began to create a style that users would find clean an unobtrusive, but still engaging
 - I created the shows, projects, and biography pages, while making a dropdown for contacts 
 - The booking link goes to a company website under which I contract
 - Included some basic styling, making links light up and increase in size against the black background so the display wasn't quite as flat
 
#Phase 3 

###Issues and troubleshooting

 - Got most of my styling commands from W3schools HTML and CSS pages
 - Initially used W3schools tryit editor for running my program, but switched to Bundles > Open in running browser to streamline my process
 - Used the validate syntax feature in bundles to correct my code
 - Encountered issues in the *Projects* page, with the referenced audio files not playing in the webpage
 - Not solved yet
 - Used gemini and textmate syntax validation to help edit code
 
#Phase 4

###Additional styling plans and uploading

 - Experimented with two different letter animations; typewriter and floating up into place
 - Decided on typewriter
 - Still developing my own style based on [these examples](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/typewriter-effect/)
 - Plans to style and personalize the audio control interface in the *Projects* page
